## General info
Coding problems for lab hours.
## Coding Language:
Javascript.
## Problem Statements :
### Lab 1 :- 
Write an algorithm to remove duplicate elements in a gen input array and print the total number of elements removed.
#### Test Cases :
```
Sample Input : [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5]
Sample Output : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Number of Elements Removed : 4
 ```
### Lab 2 :- 
Given a sorted array of distinct  integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
#### Test Cases :
```
Sample Input 1 :
Array : [1,3,5,6]
Target Element : 5
o/p : 2
Sample Input 2 :
Array : [1,3,5,6]
Target Element : 7
o/p : 4
```
#### Lab 3 :-
Given an integer array arr, return `true` if there are three consecutive odd numbers in the array. Otherwise, return `false`.
#### Test Cases :
```
Input: arr = [2,6,4,1]
Output: false
Explanation: There are no three consecutive odds.
Input CLI Constraints :
1 <= arr.length <= 1000
1 <= arr[i] <= 1000
```
